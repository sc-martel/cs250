# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

     A user's needs can be translated into a user story. The story includes a brief description of the user expectations and the acceptance criteria for development. This allows me to describe a feature from the persepective of a user and helps me get a better understanding of the user leading to a better product.


 # How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

     I approach developing a program using a lot of agile processes. I start with creating a product backlog of user stories that meet all of the criteria for my project then prioritize those stories. If I am working alone I will usual just keep a running back log and work from it as I have time, but when working with others I will seperate the user stories into sprints and assign each person a story to work on. 

 # What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

 A good team member in software development requires great communication skills, as without communication collaboration is significantly more challenging. They must also understand that the team shares a common goal and always be willing to collaborate in problem solving and be open to helping other team members overcome obstacles. Lastly a good team member will be respectful to all team members and harbor an open and encouraging work enviornment.
